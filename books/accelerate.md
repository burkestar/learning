# Accelerate - Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations

Helping the industry identify and understand the DevOps capabilities and practices that actually drive performance improvements in a statistically meaningful way.

## Summary

After years of the State of DevOps reports, Jez Humble (author of Continuous Delivery) and Gene Kim (author of Phoenix Project and other seminal DevOps books) collaborated with a social scientist to do a comprehensive cross-sectional survey of companies to test whether DevOps practices led to better business results, and which specific practices contributed towards that.

23,000 survey responses globally from 2,000 unique organizations of varying size from 5 to 10,000 employees in various industries.
