## Chapter 1 - The Question of Plant Consciousness

- Author was disillusioned climate journalist who turned to studying plants
- Fascinated by the Azolla fern which grew in Arctic Ocean as a blanket that played a crucial role in cooling the planet
- Azolla fern provide sugar to cyanobacteria which in turn transform nitrogen from the air into a form that plants and animals can use
- Fern lack a seed for reproduction which baffled scientists until they discovered under microscope that spores and sperm are used to reproduce.  They compete with other fern by releasing a hormone that slows others down.
- Plant behavior is an area of study, but the central argument is whether behaviors commonly attributed to intelligent, animal lifeforms that also exist in plants can be used to assert that plants have intelligence
- The Secret Life of Plants book from the 1970s was provocative and introduced the idea of plant intelligence and maybe even consciousness.  The book had a lot of pseudo-science and non-reproducible claims that ended up undermining the credibility of this scientific area of inquiry for decades.
- Pea shoot roots grow towards pipes carrying water, based on sound
- Plants don't have brains or neurons, which is the basis for rejecting that plants are intelligent. But scientists don't understand the biological basis and substrate that explain the intelligent behaviors they possess. Maybe the whole plant is like a brain?
- Scientists became cautious not to use "plant intelligence" as a term for fear of the reactions and rejection of their observations

## Chapter 2 - Hopw Science Changes Minds

## Chapter 3 - The Communicating Plant

## Chapter 4 - Alive to Feeling

## Chapter 5 - An Ear to the Ground

## Chapter 6 - The (Plant) Body Keeps the Score

## Chapter 7 - Conversations with Animals

- Plants not only have means to communicate with other plants, but also with animals
- Starving bees bite the leaves to induce flowers to bloom sooner so nectar energy becomes available to them
- Monkey flower deceives bumblebees to transplant their pollen for reproduction by releasing a volatile compound that tricks them into thinking there is an abundance of pollen
- Bittersweet nightshade secrete sugary nectar to attract ants who carry off the larvae of the flea beetle which protects the plant from attack when they mature
- Orchids deceive male wasps to copulate not by visual means to look like the female wasp but using pheromone semiochemicals to attract them, mate and transport their pollen
- Asters and goldenrods with their contrasting yellow and purple flowers attract more pollinators when situated together
- Silver birch absorbs scent from nearby Labrador tea plants (type of rhododendron) so a compound sticks to its own leaves and protects against weevil attack
- Plant signaling in the presence of ozone and air pollution is markedly decreased
- Corn grown hybrid and in monoculture lack the same signaling and defense mechanisms to ward off pests, resulting in dependence on pesticides
