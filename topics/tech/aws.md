# Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS is overwhelming.

**Start by learning the core services**. Other things build on top of them, so the concepts will make more sense.

- **EC2** - launch virtual machines (compute instances)
    
- **VPC networking** - how to setup a secure cloud network using subnets, security groups, NACLs, routing tables, etc.
    
- **IAM** - how to manage users, groups and permissions granted to access resources
    
- **S3** - object storage
    
- **Cloudformation** - templates for launching any AWS resource
    

Then:

- **Load balancers** (ALB / ELB)
    
- **RDS** for cloud databases
    
- **Route53** for DNS
    
- **Secrets** **Manager** for safely storing credentials
    
- **ECS** for launching docker containers
    
- **ECR** for storing docker images
    
- **EKS** for kubernetes clusters
