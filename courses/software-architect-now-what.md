https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/im-a-software/9781491935842

**You’re not a coder anymore**

- Won’t have red/green feedback like a developer
- Pay off on your efforts may take months or years
- Less time coding, more time in meetings to coordinate
- governance role

**It isn’t about pulling the next card**

- Technical skills are assumed (breadth and depth), but you won’t be consulted to solve technical problems (that’s what engineers and tech leads do)
- Analogy: not fixing a leaky pipe, but analyzing lead bearing walls when planning to expand a room on the house

**Communication continuum**

- Influence the influencers
- “A reform often advances most rapidly by indirection”
- Find common ground
- Be helpful
- Be respectful
- Do your research, have your story ready.
- What does your company value?  Innovation, cost, stability, ..?

**Relationships**

- Who knows you?

- Who can speak for you?
- Requires cultivation.  Invite someone out for coffee or lunch
- Make your coworkers feel valued.  Show interest in them!
- Be empathetic.
- Treat others the way you want to be treated.
- Ask for and offer help
- Make your work visible

**Influence**

- Find the influencers, and influence them
- “Change must happen with people, not to them” - David Hussman
- “The dip” (Seth Godin) - change is hard to maintain, because setbacks may lose momentum or derail efforts
- Change takes time, be patient
- Don’t try to change too much all at once, don’t overwhelm people

**Reviewing architectures**

- Governance review
    - Are we following our standards and best practices?
    - Are we building the right thing?
    - Are we leveraging existing capabilities?
    - Understand what we’re doing and why we’re doing it
    - More eyes, more opportunities.
    - Sanity check.
    - Socializing projects, greater awareness
    - People can pitch in to help
    - Don’t take it personal, the review is about the architecture
    - Give people enough time to review
    - Have a moderator, assign a scribe to take notes and action items

**Retrospectives**

- .

**Vendor products**

- Evaluating 3rd party products
- Identify key use cases, concerns and criteria to evaluate
- Identify risks

**Mergers and acquisitions**

- software archaeology
- are the technology stacks compatible?  Probably not
- heterogeneous environment is the norm
- identify the current state
- any regulations we need to be aware of?
- what are key architectural patterns?
- what is our ideal end state, and how to get there in multiple steps
- cost will be a major factor in decisions - whether to integrate, run standalone, sunset, etc.
