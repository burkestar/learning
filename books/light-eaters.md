# The Light Eaters

Author: Zoe Schlanger

- Author was disillusioned climate journalist who turned to studying plants
- Fascinated by the Azolla fern which grew in Arctic Ocean as a blanket that played a crucial role in cooling the planet
- The Secret Life of Plants book from the 1970s was provocative and introduced the idea of plant intelligence and maybe even consciousness.  The book had a lot of pseudo-science and non-reproducible claims that ended up undermining the credibility of this scientific area of inquiry for decades.
