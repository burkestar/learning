## Notes

### Design Goals That Inspired Rust

• **Memory safety without garbage collection** - Eliminate common bugs like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and memory leaks without the performance overhead of a garbage collector

• **Zero-cost abstractions** - Provide high-level programming constructs that compile down to the same performance as hand-written low-level code

• **Concurrency without data races** - Enable safe concurrent programming by preventing data races at compile time rather than runtime

• **Systems-level control with high-level ergonomics** - Give programmers fine-grained control over system resources while maintaining expressive, readable code

• **Practical performance** - Achieve performance comparable to C and C++ while being safer and more productive to use

• **Reliability and correctness** - Catch as many bugs as possible at compile time rather than allowing them to surface at runtime

• **Fearless concurrency** - Make concurrent programming accessible to more developers by eliminating common pitfalls through language design

• **Cross-platform compatibility** - Run efficiently on everything from embedded devices to web servers with consistent behavior

• **Interoperability with existing systems** - Integrate seamlessly with C codebases and existing system libraries

• **Developer productivity** - Provide helpful compiler messages, excellent tooling, and modern language features that reduce development time

### Language Features

#### Core Safety Features

• **Ownership system** - Compile-time memory management through move semantics, borrowing, and lifetimes that eliminates manual memory management

• **Borrow checker** - Static analysis that prevents data races, use-after-free errors, and other memory safety issues at compile time

• **No null pointers** - Use `Option<T>` type instead of nullable references, eliminating null pointer dereferences

• **Pattern matching with exhaustiveness checking** - Comprehensive match expressions that ensure all cases are handled

#### Type System

• **Strong static typing** - Catch type errors at compile time with sophisticated type inference

• **Generics with zero runtime cost** - Monomorphization creates specialized versions of generic code for each concrete type used

• **Traits system** - Flexible interface system similar to type classes that enables code reuse and polymorphism

• **Algebraic data types** - Powerful enum types that can hold different kinds of data, enabling expressive domain modeling

#### Concurrency and Parallelism

• **Send and Sync traits** - Type system markers that indicate whether types can be safely transferred between threads or shared between threads

• **Channels for message passing** - Built-in communication primitives for passing data between threads safely

• **Async/await syntax** - Native support for asynchronous programming with futures and async functions

• **Thread-safe reference counting** - `Arc<T>` and `Rc<T>` types for safe memory sharing

#### Performance Features

• **Zero-cost abstractions** - High-level constructs compile to efficient machine code without runtime overhead

• **No garbage collector** - Deterministic memory management without stop-the-world pauses

• **Minimal runtime** - Very small runtime system that doesn't interfere with performance-critical code

• **Inline assembly support** - Direct access to assembly language when maximum performance is needed

#### Modern Language Design

• **Expression-oriented syntax** - Most constructs are expressions that return values, enabling functional programming patterns

• **Closures with flexible capture** - Anonymous functions that can capture their environment by value, reference, or mutable reference

• **Cargo package manager and build system** - Integrated dependency management, building, testing, and documentation generation

• **Comprehensive standard library** - Rich set of data structures, I/O primitives, and system interfaces

#### Developer Experience

• **Helpful compiler messages** - Detailed error messages with suggestions for fixes and explanations of ownership issues

• **Built-in testing framework** - Unit tests, integration tests, and documentation tests are first-class language features

• **Documentation comments** - Comments that generate API documentation and can include runnable code examples

• **Rustfmt for consistent formatting** - Official code formatter that enforces consistent style across projects

• **Clippy linter** - Advanced static analysis tool that suggests improvements and catches common mistakes

#### Interoperability

• **Foreign Function Interface (FFI)** - Direct calling of C functions and libraries with minimal overhead

• **C-compatible data layout** - Structs and enums can be made compatible with C representations

• **WebAssembly target** - First-class compilation target for running Rust code in web browsers and other WASM environments

These design goals and features work together to create a language that delivers the performance and control of systems programming languages while providing the safety and productivity of higher-level languages.
