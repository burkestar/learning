# Being a human

We tend to over-complicate how to live life as a human. There is an over-abundance of self-improvement, personal development, wellness, and lifehack materials.  It really doesn't need to be so hard. And it's all too easy to overlook the basic things which are the actual foundation of living a meaningful, happy, satisfied existence.

## Surviving

The "rule of threes" helps remember roughly how long the human body can survive without:

- **Air** - 3 minutes
- **Shelter** - 3 hours in extreme heat or cold
- **Water** - 3 days
- **Food** - 3 weeks

We need not only access to these critical resources, but high quality of them to enrich our bodies.

- **Go outside and breathe the fresh air**. Every day. Ideally surrounded by nature where air quality is best. Just like plants need sunshine to grow, humans do too.
- You need a **place to live that is safe** from threats (from nature or humans) with adequate living conditions (good temperature, clean). You don't need as much space as you might think but it must have separate places to eat, sleep and take care of hygiene.  Ideally it will be spacious and quiet with a comfortable space to rest, think and do focused work.
- **Water**. Drink it every day. Get a water tumbler that is safe from harmful chemicals, holds at least 18 ounces, and keeps the water cool. I recommend a Yeti 26 ounce tumbler.  Carry it everywhere. Drink 2 of them each day.  Chug a large amount to start your day in the morning.  When our bodies are hydrated, they can produce energy. Water is essential at a cellular level.

## Notes

- **Sleep**. You need to be well rested to feel and perform at your best. 7-8 hours. Every night. If your bed is not comfortable, fix that. Ideally it's quiet and dark, so find ways to fix noise (move somewhere quiet, noise machine, ear plugs) and light (light blocking curtains, turn off all indoor light sources including lights on electronics in your room).  No caffeine after 2pm. Early to bed, early to rise. Start your bedtime ritual at the same time each night, ideally around 8-9pm.  No screens, dim the lights, do something that helps your brain wind down - like reading a book. Drink some night-time tea (I recommend Yogi) that are caffeine-free and have calming herbs like chamomile. Get up early to enjoy the peace and quiet, and get a jumpstart on your day. I am the most focused, motivated, and creative in the mornings so that's when I get most of my important work done.
- **Be active**. Get outside moving 30 minutes each day. Walking is enough. Gardening counts.
