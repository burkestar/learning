# Typescript

Typescript adds static typing with optional type annotations to Javascript.  Typescript is transpiled to Javascript so that it can run anywhere Javascript does.

## Resources

* **[The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html):** This is the definitive manual. If you already know JavaScript, start with the **"TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers"** guide.
* **[The TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play):** An essential browser-based editor that shows you exactly how your TS code transpiles to JS in real-time. It’s perfect for testing complex types.
* **[TSConfig Reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig):** Authoritative documentation on how to configure your project. Understanding `strict: true` and `target` settings is vital for professional work.
* **[Concise Typescript Book](https://github.com/gibbok/typescript-book?tab=readme-ov-file):**

## Books

* **[Effective TypeScript](https://effectivetypescript.com/) (Dan Vanderkam):** Often called the "Effective C++" of the TS world. It provides 62 specific ways to improve your code. Best for those who already know the basics.
* **[Programming TypeScript](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-typescript/9781492037644/) (Boris Cherny):** A comprehensive O'Reilly guide that covers everything from types to how to scale a large codebase.

## Practice

* **[TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/):** A free, community-driven online book by Basarat Ali Syed. It is legendary for explaining the "internals" of the compiler.
* **[Type Challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges):** A GitHub repository of puzzles ranging from "Easy" to "Extreme." This is where you go to practice Generics and Mapped Types.
* **[Jack Herrington (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/@jherr):** Excellent for "No BS" tutorials on using TypeScript with React and modern frameworks.

> **Pro Tip:** When learning, always keep your `tsconfig.json` set to `strict: true`. It will be harder at first, but it prevents you from learning "lazy" habits that defeat the purpose of using TypeScript.
