## Writing Better Lyrics


Ch 1: Object Writing
- Object writing
	- Arbitrarily pick an object and focus senses on it
	- Organic sense - awareness of inner bodily function
	- Kinesthetic sense - sense of relation to world around you
	- Practice for 10 minutes in the morning, best time of day
	- More is gained practicing a short time each day than doing it all at once
- who, what, when, where, why, how
	- every song must answer: who is talking?  who are they talking to?
	- what is the song about? what is the character trying to say?
	- why?
	- practice by people watching

Ch 2: Rusty's Collar - Lesson in Showing and Telling
- you can't tell unless you show first
	- showing makes telling more powerful because your senses and your mind are both engaged

Ch 3: Making Metaphors
- Types of metaphors
	- Expressed identity metaphor asserts an identity between two nouns (e.g. fear is a shadow). 
	  "x is y" (fear is a shadow)"the y of x" (the shadow of fear)"x's y" (fear's shadow)
	- qualifying metaphor - adjectives to qualify nouns, adverbs to qualify verbs (e.g. hasty clouds)
	- verbal metaphor - conflicts between verb and its subject and/or object (e.g. clouds sail)
- Playing in keys
	- words can be grouped together in close relationships like belonging to the same key.  Diatonic relationship. (e.g. tide: ocean, moon, recede, power, beach)
	- metaphor works by revealing some third thing that two ideas share in common.
	- what characteristics does my idea have?
	- what else has those characteristics?
- Simile
	- Similes don't transfer focus.  "My love is an engine, it ain't run in years" vs "My love's like an engine, it ain't run in years".
